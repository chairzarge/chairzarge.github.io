        <h2>Module #3 (Week 3) - Introduction to CSS: Color, Text, Boxes, List, Tables & Forms</h2>

        <h3>Description: </h3>
        
        <p>
            This week we are presented the new idea of CSS which is used to style your html by using declarations within element selectors.
            These declarations consist of a "&lt;property> : &lt;value>" pair. Examples include the "color" property which can have a string,
            RGB, hex, or HSL value; the "font-family" property, which determines the type of font used for the element text; and plenty of others.
        </p>

        <h3>Reflection: </h3>
        <p>
            CSS is pretty straight forward, but you can do a lot of with it. I think I got a good grasp of it this week and hope to learn more in the following.
