            <div class="info">
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I decided to enroll in PROG109 - Intro
                to Web-Development to take my skills to the next level and lay a
                stable foundation for my future web-development. Throughout the
                course, I gained a deeper understanding of HTML, CSS, and
                JavaScript and how they work together to create dynamic and
                responsive websites.

                <br>
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;On this portfolio website, you'll find
                examples of my work and the projects I completed during the
                course. I'm proud of the progress I've made and the skills I've
                learned, and I'm excited to continue growing as a web developer.
                <br>
                <br>
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;In addition to web development, I'm also
                interested in other programming related ventures, math, science,
                and general STEM topics. I believe that having a well-rounded
                set of skills and interests makes me a better developer and
                helps me bring unique perspectives to my work. I hope to enter
                the software development industry, and I'm currently taking
                intro programming courses to see what I enjoy and what I don't
                (including this one!).
