            Q: What was your previous knowledge of HTML/CSS/Javascript?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            A: I had zero experience with both HTML and CSS, with both of these
            concepts being completely new to me. However, the class AP CSP used
            JavaScript in AppLab (code.org) for basic coding concepts. This
            covered topics like "events", "loops", "variables", and "objects".

            Q: Did you use a template or did you build your portfolio from scratch?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            A: I built my portfolio from scratch. First, I wrote a template page
            that contained the nav-bar. Then, I used external CSS file to create
            a consistent theme across pages and format the nav-bar just right
            for all screen-sizes (but not mobile).

        <div class="question">
            Q: What was your most challenging part of your portfolio (ie, the template, artifacts, CSS, etc.)?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            A: Nothing was particularly challenging, but I guess the "most"
            challenging was the auto-playing music because Chrome blocks
            autoplay if the user has yet to interact with the page yet. I was
            able to get around this with the "onclick" event if autoplay were to
            fail.

        <div class="question">
            Q: How taking this class changed your view on Web Development? 
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            A: It didn't really. I figured it would be similar to this as I have
            taken coding classes in the past and I was right. New topic,
            practice it, apply it, repeat. With that said, I'm excited to
            explore this topic further though with plans to learn about back-end
            development, databases, and front-end frameworks.

            Q: What would you recommend to future students taking this class?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            A: Don't worry about not having any experience coding. The class is
            straight forward, giving you plenty of opportunities to practice and
            apply your knowledge. Just make sure to utilize those opportunities
            and not fall behind.
